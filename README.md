### About Jeroo
*Jeroo* is an online program that simulates C++/Java code but removes most of the features.
* Useful as an introduction to object-oriented programming and the fundementals of classes and methods.
* There are various Jeroo-specific methods that allow interaction with game-like mechanics.
* The platform is accessible via https://www.jeroo.org/beta.
* In many ways, this is a lot like Code.org.
